i hate you for what you did
and i miss you like a little kid
i faked it every time
but that's alright
i can hardly feel anything
i hardly feel anything at all
you gave me fifteen hundred
to see your hypnotherapist
i only went one time
you let it slide
fell on hard times a year ago
was hoping you would let it go, and you did
i have emotional motion sickness
somebody roll the windows down
there are no words in the english language
i could scream to drown you out
i'm on the outside looking through
you're throwing rocks around your room
and while you're bleeding on your back
in the glass
i'll be glad that i made it out
and sorry that it all went down like it did
i have emotional motion sickness
somebody roll the windows down
there are no words in the english language
i could scream to drown you out
hey, why do you sing with an english accent?
i guess it's too late to change it now
you know i'm never gonna let you have it
but i will try to drown you out
you said when you met me, you were bored
you said when you met me, you were bored
and you, you were in a band when i was born
i have emotional motion sickness
i try to stay clean and live without
and i want to know what would happen
if i surrender to the sound
surrender to the sound
day off in kyoto
got bored at the temple
looked around at the 7-eleven
the band took the speed train
went to the arcade
i wanted to go, but i didn't
you called me from a payphone
they still got payphones
it cost a dollar a minute
to tell me you're getting sober
and you wrote me a letter
but i don't have to read it
i'm gonna kill you
if you don't beat me to it
dreaming through tokyo skies
i wanted to see the world
then i flew over the ocean
and i changed my mind (woo)
sunset's been a freak show
on the weekend, so
i've been driving out to the suburbs
to park at the goodwill
and stare at the chem trails
with my little brother
he said you called on his birthday
you were off by like ten days
but you get a few points for tryin'
remember getting the truck fixed
when you let us drive it
twenty-five felt like flying
i don't forgive you
but please don't hold me to it
born under scorpio skies
i wanted to see the world
through your eyes until it happened
then i changed my mind
guess i lied
i'm a liar
who lies
'cause i'm a liar
somewhere in germany, but i can't place it
man, i hate this part of texas
close my eyes, fantasize
three clicks and i'm home
when i get back i'll lay around
then i'll get up and lay back down
romanticize a quiet life
there's no place like my room
but you had to go, i know, i know, i know
like a wave that crashed and melted on the shore
not even the burnouts are out here anymore
and you had to go, i know, i know, i know
out in the park, we watch the sunset
talking on a rusty swing set
after a while you went quiet
and i got mean
i'm always pushing you away from me
but you come back with gravity
and when i call, you come home
a bird in your teeth
so i gotta go, i know, i know, i know
when the sirens sound, you'll hide under the floor
but i'm not gonna go down with my hometown in a tornado
i'm gonna chase it, i know, i know, i know
i gotta go now, i know, i know, i know
driving out into the sun
let the ultraviolet cover me up
went looking for a creation myth
ended up with a pair of cracked lips
windows down, scream along
to some america first rap country song
a slaughterhouse, an outlet mall
slot machines, fear of god
windows down, heater on
big bolt of lightning hanging low
over the coast, everyone's convinced
it's a government drone or an alien spaceship
either way, we're not alone
i'll find a new place to be from
a haunted house with a picket fence
to float around and ghost my friends
no, i'm not afraid to disappear
the billboard said "the end is near"
i turned around, there was nothing there
yeah, i guess the end is here
the end is here
the end is here
the end is here
the end is... ahh!
you asked to walk me home
but i had to carry you
and you pushed me in
and now my feet can't touch the bottom of you
you couldn't have
you couldn't have
stuck your tongue down the throat of somebody
who loves you more
so i will wait for the next time you want me
like a dog with a bird at your door
mmm
we hate tears in heaven
but it's sad that his baby died
and we fought about john lennon
until i cried
and then went to bed upset
but now i am dreaming
and you're singing at my birthday
and i've never seen you smiling so big
it's nautical themed
and there's something i'm supposed to say
but can't for the life of me
remember what it is
and if i could give you the moon
i would give you the moon
you are sick and you're married
and you might be dying
but you're holding me like water in your hands
when you saw the dead little bird
you started crying
but you know the killer doesn't understand
someday, i'm gonna live
in your house up on the hill
and when your skinhead neighbor goes missing
i'll plant a garden in the yard, then
they're gluing roses on a flatbed
you should see it, i mean thousands
i grew up here, 'til it all went up in flames
except the notches in the door frame
i don't know when you got taller
see our reflection in the water
off a bridge at the huntington
i hopped the fence when i was seventeen
then i knew what i wanted
and when i grow up, i'm gonna look up
from my phone and see my life
and it's gonna be just like my recurring dream
i'm at the movies, i don't remember what i'm seeing
the screen turns into a tidal wave
then it's a dorm room, like a hedge maze
and when i find you
you touch my leg, and i insist
but i wake up before we do it
i don't know how, but i'm taller
it must be something in the water
everything's growing in our garden
you don't have to know that it's haunted
the doctor put her hands over my liver
she told me my resentment's getting smaller
no, i'm not afraid of hard work
i get everything i want
i have everything i wanted
when the speed kicks in
i go to the store for nothing
and walk right by
the house where you lived with snow white
i wonder if she ever thought
the storybook tiles on the roof were too much
but from the window, it's not a bad show
if your favorite thing's dianetics or stucco
the drugstores are open all night
the only real reason i moved to the east side
i love a good place to hide in plain sight
what if i told you
i feel like i know you?
but we never met
and here, everyone knows you're the way to my heart
hear so many stories of you at the bar
most times, alone, and some, looking your worst
but never not sweet to the trust funds and punishers
man, i wish that i could say the same
i swear i'm not angry, that's just my face
a copycat killer with a chemical cut
either i'm careless or i wanna get caught
who i'm not
what if i told you
i feel like i know you?
but we never met
it's for the best
i can't open my mouth and forget how to talk
'cause even if i could
wouldn't know where to start
wouldn't know when to stop
i went with you up to the place you grew up in
we spent a week in the cold
just long enough to walden it with you
any longer, it would've got old
singing "ace of spades" when lemmy died
but nothing's changed, l.a.'s alright
i'm sleeping in my bed again, and getting in my head
and then, walk around the reservoir
you, you must've been looking for me
sending smoke signals
pelicans circling
burning trash out on the beach
one of your eyes is always half-shut
something happened when you were a kid
i didn't know you then and i'll never understand
why it feels like i did
"how soon is now" in an 80s sedan
you slept inside of it because your dad
lived in a campground in the back of a van
you said that song'll creep you out until you're dead
and you must've been looking for me
sending smoke signals
pelicans circling
burning trash out on the beach
i want to live at the holiday inn
where somebody else makes the bed
we'll watch tv while the lights on the street
put all the stars to death
it's been on my mind since bowie died
just checking out to hide from life
and all of our problems, i'm gonna solve 'em
with you riding shotgun, speeding, 'cause fuck the cops
and you, you must've been looking for me
sending smoke signals
pelicans circling
burning trash out on the beach
i buried a hatchet, it's coming up lavender
the future's unwritten; the past is a corridor
i'm at the exit, looking back through the hall
you are anonymous, i am a concrete wall
emotional affair
overly sincere
smoking in the car, windows up
crocodile tears, run the tap 'til it's clear
drift off on the floor
i drag you to the shore
sweating through the sheets
you're gonna drown in your sleep for sure
wake up and start a big fire
in our one room apartment
but i'm too tired
to have a pissing contest
all the bad dreams that you hide
show me yours, i'll show you mine
call me when you land
i'll drive around again
one hand on the wheel, one in your mouth
turn me on and turn me down
baby, you're a vampire
you want blood and i promised
i'm a bad liar
with a savior complex
all the skeletons you hide
show me yours, and i'll show you mine
all the bad dreams that you hide
show me yours
i've been running around in circles
pretending to be myself
why would somebody do this on purpose
when they could do something else?
drowning out the morning birds
with the same three songs over and over
i wish i wrote it, but i didn't so i learn the words
hum along 'til the feeling's gone forever
took a tour to see the stars
but they weren't out tonight
so i wished hard on a chinese satellite
i want to believe
instead, i look at the sky and i feel nothing
you know i hate to be alone
i want to be wrong
you were screamin' at the evangelicals
they were screamin' right back from what i remember
when you said i will never be your vegetable
because i think when you're gone, it's forever
but you know i'd stand on the corner
embarrassed with a picket sign
if it meant i would see you when i die
sometimes, when i can't sleep
it's just a matter of time before i'm hearing things
swore i could feel you through the walls
but that's impossible
i want to believe
that if i go outside i'll see a tractor beam
coming to take me to where i'm from
i want to go home
no longer a danger to herself or others
she made up her mind and laced up her shoes
yelled down the hall, but nobody answered
so she walked outside without an excuse
she can do anything she wants to
she can do whatever she wants to do
she can go home, but she's not going to
so she picks a direction, it's ninety in memphis
turns up the music so thoughts don't intrude
predictably winds up thinking of elvis
and wonders if he believed songs could come true
i'm asking for it if they do
doesn't know what she wants or what she's gonna do
a rebel without a clue
so we spent what was left of our serotonin
to chew on our cheeks and stare at the moon
said she knows she lived through it to get to this moment
ate a sleeve of saltines on my floor and i knew then
i would do anything you want me to
i would do anything for you
i would do anything, i would do anything
whatever you want me to do, i will do
whatever she wants
whatever she wants
whatever she wants (whatever you want)
whatever she wants (whatever you want)
i would do anything (whatever you want)
i would do anything (whatever you want)
whatever she wants (whatever you want)
whatever she wants (whatever you want)
i'm singing at a funeral tomorrow
for a kid a year older than me
and i've been talking to his dad; it makes me so sad
when i think too much about it i can't breathe
and i have this dream where i'm screaming underwater
while my friends are waving from the shore
and i don't need you to tell me what that means
i don't believe in that stuff anymore
jesus christ, i'm so blue all the time
and that's just how i feel
always have and i always will
i always have and always will
i have a friend i call
when i've bored myself to tears
and we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves
but then we laugh until it disappears
and last night, i blacked out in my car
and i woke up in my childhood bed
wishing i was someone else, feeling sorry for myself
when i remembered someone's kid is dead
jesus christ, i'm so blue all the time
and that's just how i feel
always have and i always will
i always have and always will
and it's 4 a.m. again
and i'm doing nothing
again
laying down on the lawn
i'm tired of trying to get in the house
i'm thinking out loud
i've been playing dead
my whole life
and i get this feeling whenever i feel good
it'll be the last time
but i feel something when i see you now
i feel something when i see you
if you're a work of art
i'm standing too close
i can see the brush strokes
i hate your mom
i hate it when she opens her mouth
it's amazing to me how much you can say
when you don't know what you're talking about
but i feel something when i see you now
i feel something when i see you
i used to light you up
now i can't even get you to play the drums
'cause i don't know what i want
until i fuck it up
but i feel something when i see you now
i feel something
i'll climb through the window again
but right now, it feels good not to stand
then i'll leave it wide open
let the dystopian morning light pour in
walking scott street, feeling like a stranger
with an open heart, open container
i've got a stack of mail and a tall can
it's a shower beer, it's a payment plan
there's helicopters over my head
every night when i go to bed
spending money, and i earned it
when i'm lonely, that's when i'll burn it
do you feel ashamed
when you hear my name?
i asked you, "how is your sister?
i heard she got her degree."
and i said, "that makes me feel old"
you said, "what does that make me?"
i asked you, "how is playing drums?"
said, "it's too much shit to carry"
"and what about the band?"
you said, "they're all getting married"
do you feel ashamed
when you hear my name?
anyway, don't be a stranger
anyway, don't be a stranger
don't be a stranger
broke into her house, saw her sitting there
drinking coke and whiskey in her bra and underwear
saw him in the kitchen, hanging up the phone
i asked him nicely once to pack his things and go
he gave her a reassuring look, said he wouldn't leave
but i asked him one more time, this time pulled out my shiv
stuck him in the back, and i pulled it out slow
and i watched him fall down, and as the morning sun rose
he looked at me, he said:
"you missed my heart, you missed my heart
you got me good; i knew you would
but you missed my heart, you missed my heart"
were his last words before he died
looking out the window, up at the blue sky
listening to her scream, listening to her cry
a feeling of relief came over my soul
i couldn't take it any longer, and i lost control
i chased her up the stairs and i pinned her to the ground
and underneath her whimpering, i could hear the sirens sound
i rattled off a list of all the things i miss
like going to the movies with her and the way she kissed me
driving into downtown wheeling, showing her off
backyard barbecues and reunions in the park
i said i missed her skin, when she started laughing
while i clenched down on her wrist, she said
"that's quite a list, but there's one thing you missed"
"you missed my heart, you missed my heart
that's quite a list, but what you really missed
you missed my heart, you missed my heart (you missed my heart)
that's quite a list, but what you really missed"
running through the parking lot, running through the fields
policemen on my back, something hit my skull and cracked
they dragged me off to jail, set a million dollar bail
where i tried to tie a noose, but i failed and i broke loose
i went racing through the prison yard, shot down by a tower guard
he got me in the shins, and he got me in the arms
they strapped me in the gurney, took me off to the infirmary
where the priest read my last rites
and just before everything went dark, i said
"he missed my heart, he missed my heart (you missed my heart)
he got me good, i knew he would
but he missed my heart, he missed my heart" (you missed my heart)
and just before everything went dark
the most poetic dream came flowing like the sea
laying there, my lifeblood draining out of me
a childhood scene, night sky, moon beams
fishing with my friends, sittin' in the wild reeds
watching the ohio river flow at night
waitin' for the bullheaded catfishes to bite
downriver from the moundsville prison graveyard
downriver from the moundsville prison graveyard
downriver from the moundsville prison graveyard
downriver from the moundsville prison graveyard
downriver from the moundsville prison graveyard
i hate living by the hospital
the sirens go all night
i used to joke that if they woke you up
somebody better be dying
sick of the questions i keep asking you
they make you live in the past
but i can count on you to tell me the truth
when you've been drinking and you're wearing a mask
baby, it's halloween
and we can be anything
oh, come on, man
we can be anything
always surprised by what i do for love
some things i never expect
they killed a fan down by the stadium
was only visiting, they beat him to death
baby, it's halloween
and we can be anything
oh, come on, man
we can be anything
baby, it's halloween
there's a last time for everything
oh, come on, man
we can be anything
whatever you want
i'll be whatever you want
whatever you want
be whatever you want
i'll be whatever you want
whatever you want
i'll be whatever you want
whatever you want
whatever you want
sometimes i think i'm a killer
i scared you in your house
i even scared myself by talking
about dahmer on your couch
but i can't sleep next to a body
even harmless in death
plus, i'm pretty sure i'd miss you
and faking sleep to count your breath
can the killer in me
tame the fire in you?
or is there nothing left to do for us?
i am sick of the chase
but i'm hungry for blood
and there's nothing i can do
but when i'm sick and tired
and when my mind is barely there
when a machine keeps me alive
and i'm losing all my hair
i hope you kiss my rotten head
and pull the plug
know that i've burned every playlist
and i've given all my love
can the killer in me
tame the fire in you?
i know there's something waiting for us
i am sick of the chase
but i'm stupid in love
and there's nothing i can do
and there's nothing i can do
georgia, georgia, i love your son
and when he gets older, he might be the one
he might be the one
georgia, georgia, he has beautiful bones
and he never lies or picks up his phone
and sometimes in the pouring rain
he'll fall in the mud and get back up again
and if you find me, will you know me?
will you take me, or will you fall?
here is my day plan, here's my new machine
he is a fine new addition, so young and so clean
so young and so clean
he came up through the water without a sound
with my back to the shoreline, i dreamt that he drowned
i dreamt that he drowned
and sometimes, when he looks at me
i know he needs you, you're all that he sees
and if i breathe you, will it kill me?
will you have me, or watch me fall?
if i fix you, will you hate me?
and would you fuck this and let us fall?
take a dirty picture, babe
i can't sleep and i miss your face
in my hands and in my knees
tell me what you wanna do to me
tell me what you'll do, please
i don't wanna be alone
don't wanna be alone anymore
it got quiet on the other line
said the sun was coming up, and i
laughed until i couldn't breathe
now i'm too tired to go to sleep
now i can't breathe, and i can't sleep
i don't wanna be stoned
i don't wanna be stoned anymore
i don't wanna be alone
don't wanna be alone anymore
i've got a good feeling
i've got a good feeling
it doesn't happen very often
playing "would you rather"
when it comes to fire
you always say that you'd prefer to drown
you were still in the ambulance
when the cop suggested you're the one
who tried to burn it down
come to find out
i'm a can on a string, you're on the end
we found our way out
of the suicide pact of our family and friends
in the background, i'll be waiting
we have the same face
i laid awake as someone shoved you up against a wall
quarantined in a bad dream
he's half the man and you're twice as tall
come to find out
i'm a can on a string, you're on the end
we found our way out
of the suicide pact of our family and friends
in the background, i'll be waiting
next time i see you, you'll show me
a hundred different ways to say the same things
come to find out
i'm a can on a string, you're on the end
we found our way out
of the suicide pact of our family and friends
and when you touch down, i'll be waving
for a chemical imbalance
you sure know how to ride a train
your revolution is a deathbed
and the music is your maid
when someone comes a-knockin'
with a needle on a tray
only your lonesome lies beside you
for you told me not to stay
you are somebody's baby
some mother held you near
no, it's not important, they're just pretty words, my dear
there is no distraction that can make me disappear
no, there's nothing that won't remind you
i will always be right here
and you spit the blood back
spit the blood back, baby
i'm amazed that you're alright
oh, so long, prison boy
i won't be home with you tonight
we're both very sick, our muscles are worn down
it's as if we are one-hundred, know i won't still be around
because i've fallen
yes, i've fallen right into the love i've found
long before i reach one-hundred
i'll have fallen to the ground
and for generations, they'll romance us, make us more
or much less than ever was before
the chelsea and the floor
make us stand before the masses
like two speakers for the poor
when there was no revolution
nothing we were fighting for
and you spit the blood back
spit the blood back, baby
i'm amazed that you're alright
oh, so long, prison boy
i won't be home, i won't be home
i won't be home with you tonight
and you can call the service bell
when we stay at the chelsea hotel
and i'll stay out of my own hell
oh, so long, prison boy
i won't be home, i won't be home
i won't be home with you tonight
tonight
sometimes i think i'm a killer
scared you in your house
even scared myself by talking
about dahmer on your couch
but i can't sleep next to a body
even harmless in death
plus i'm pretty sure i'd miss you
faking sleep to count your breath
can the killer in me
tame the fire in you?
is there nothing left to do for us?
i am sick of the chase
but i'm hungry for blood
and there's nothing i can do
but when i'm sick and tired
when my mind is barely there
when a machine keeps me alive
and i'm losing all my hair
i hope you kiss my rotten head
and pull the plug
know that i've burned every playlist
and given all my love
can the killer in me
tame the fire in you?
i know there's something waiting for us
i am sick of the chase
but i'm stupid in love
and there's nothing i can do
and there's nothing i can do
nothing ever comes like it did when you were in it
just a memory of a kid, just a washed out finish
just a pain-in-the-ass johnny cash middle finger
no shooting up drugs, no quitter is a winner
nothing ever comes like it did when you were in it
keeping nothing for yourself like a stone cold killer
now you're passing your people like a ship in the night
looking to every stranger for a fight
nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
open up your mouth, your mouth if you want it
listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down
hoping that you like, that you like how you're living
relying on the kindness of strangers that you will be forgiven
how many times, how many times will you shit on what you're given?
how many times, how many times 'til you shut up and listen?
nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
open up your mouth, your mouth if you want it
listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down
nothing ever comes, ever comes
choking like a dog, like a dog
open up your mouth
listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down
nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
open up your mouth if you want it
listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming downi am tired of being sad
i feel it when i wake up
and it just stays bad
it hits me like a sickness
or a steamroller
makes me wanna lay down
and get run over
but then i see you
always smiling
makes me wanna touch you
keep from dying
you're a brother to me
you're my partner in crime
you're the feeling i get
when i'm feeling fine
part of me wants you
but most of me needs you
so i won't fall unless you ask me to
we talk for hours
until finally
sleep takes over
the amphetamines
in the darkness
i feel your fingers
they don't touch me
but theres a danger
you're a brother to me
you're my partner in crime
your the feeling i get
when i'm feeling fine
part of me wants you
but most of me needs you
so i won't fall unless you ask me
you're a brother to me
you're my partner in crime
you're the feeling i get
when i'm feeling fine
part of me wants you
but most of me needs you
so i won't fall unless you ask me if you were a teacher, i would fail your class
take it over and over 'til you noticed me
if you were a waiting room, i would never see a doctor
i would sit there with my first aid kit and bleed
i want to be the power ballad that lifts you up and holds you down
i wanna be the broken love song that feeds your misery
and i can wish all that i want, but it won't bring us together
plus i know whatever happens to me, i know it's for the better
and when broken bodies are washed ashore
who am i to ask for more, more, more?
but you're breathing in my open mouth
you're the gun in my lips that will blow my brains out
i want to make you drive all night just because i said maybe you should come over
i want to make you fall in love as hard as my poor parents teenage daughter
she'll be the best you ever had if you let her
i know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better

if we make it through december
everything's gonna be alright, i know
it's the coldest time of winter
and i shiver when i see the falling snow
if we make it through december
got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
maybe even california
if we make it through december, we'll be fine
got laid off at the factory
and their timing is not the greatest in the world
heaven knows i've been working hard
wanted christmas to be right for my girl
i don't mean to hate december
it's meant to be the happy time of year
and my little girl don't understand
why we can't afford no christmas here
if we make it through december
everything's gonna be alright, i know
it's the coldest time of winter
and i shiver when i see the falling snow
if we make it through december
got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
maybe even california
if we make it through december, we'll be fine
maybe even california
if we make it through december, we'll be fine
i don't care if monday's blue
tuesday's grey and wednesday too
thursday i don't care about you
it's friday, i'm in love
monday you can fall apart
tuesday, wednesday, break my heart
thursday doesn't even start
it's friday, i'm in love
saturday, wait
and sunday always comes too late
but friday, never hesitate
i don't care if monday's black
tuesday, wednesday heart attack
oh, thursday never looking back
it's friday, i'm in love
monday you can hold your head
tuesday, wednesday stay in bed
or thursday watch the walls instead
it's friday, i'm in love
saturday, wait
and sunday always comes too late
friday, never hesitate
dressed up to the eyes
it's such a wonderful surprise
to see your shoes and your spirits rise
throwing out your frown
smile at the sound
as sleek as a shriek spinning round and round
always take a big bite
such a gorgeous sight
to see you eat in the middle of the night
you can never get enough
enough of this stuff
it's friday i'm in love
i don't care if monday's blue
tuesday's grey and wednesday too
thursday i don't care about you
it's friday, i'm in love
monday you can fall apart
tuesday, wednesday break my heart
thursday doesn't even start
it's friday, i'm in love
comin' back from the country
full of good food and lousy beer
this winter's so dry and the dirt road so dusty
at the lightest fall of rain, the bacteria bloom
you don't have to be alone to be lonesome
it's easy to forget
the sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
and it's christmas so no one can fix it
tethered to a table with that happy holiday crowd
and it's anchors aweigh
looks like smooth sailin'
but the merest hint of waves could capsize you
you don't have to be alone to be lonesome
it's so easy to forget
the sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
and it's christmas so no one can fix it
the desire for annihilation
is as common as it is unkind
and it's hard to recognize the situation
when you're desperately tryin' to have a good time
you don't have to be alone to be lonesome
it's easy to forget
the sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
and it's christmas so no one can fix it
yeah, it's christmas
so no one can fix itshe wore faded jeans and soft black leather
she had eyes so blue they looked like weather
when she needed me i wasn't around
that's the way it goes, it'll all work out
there were times apart and times together
i was pledged to her for worse or better
when it mattered most i let her down
that's the way it goes, it'll all work out
it'll all work out eventually
better off with him than here with me
now the wind is high and the rain is heavy
the water's rising in the levee
still i think of her when the sun goes down
never goes away, but it all works out
never goes away, but it all works out
silent night, holy night!
all is calm, all is bright
round yon virgin, mother and child
holy infant so tender and mild
sleep in heavenly peace
sleep in heavenly peace
silent night, holy night!
shepherds quake at the sight
glories stream from heaven afar
heavenly hosts sing 'alleluia!
christ the savior is born
christ the savior is born
silent night, holy night!
son of god, love's pure light
radiant beams from thy holy face
with the dawn of redeeming grace
jesus lord, at thy birth
jesus lord, at thy birth
