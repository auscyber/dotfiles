someday, i'm gonna live
in your house up on the hill
and when your skinhead neighbor goes missing
i'll plant a garden in the yard, then
they're gluing roses on a flatbed
you should see it, i mean thousands
i grew up here, 'til it all went up in flames
except the notches in the door frame
i don't know when you got taller
see our reflection in the water
off a bridge at the huntington
i hopped the fence when i was seventeen
then i knew what i wanted
and when i grow up, i'm gonna look up
from my phone and see my life
and it's gonna be just like my recurring dream
i'm at the movies, i don't remember what i'm seeing
the screen turns into a tidal wave
then it's a dorm room, like a hedge maze
and when i find you
you touch my leg, and i insist
but i wake up before we do it
i don't know how, but i'm taller
it must be something in the water
everything's growing in our garden
you don't have to know that it's haunted
the doctor put her hands over my liver
she told me my resentment's getting smaller
no, i'm not afraid of hard work
i get everything i want
i have everything i wanted
