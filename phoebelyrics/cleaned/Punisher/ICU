laying down on the lawn
i'm tired of trying to get in the house
i'm thinking out loud
i've been playing dead
my whole life
and i get this feeling whenever i feel good
it'll be the last time
but i feel something when i see you now
i feel something when i see you
if you're a work of art
i'm standing too close
i can see the brush strokes
i hate your mom
i hate it when she opens her mouth
it's amazing to me how much you can say
when you don't know what you're talking about
but i feel something when i see you now
i feel something when i see you
i used to light you up
now i can't even get you to play the drums
'cause i don't know what i want
until i fuck it up
but i feel something when i see you now
i feel something
i'll climb through the window again
but right now, it feels good not to stand
then i'll leave it wide open
let the dystopian morning light pour in
