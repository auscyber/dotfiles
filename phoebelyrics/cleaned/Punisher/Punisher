when the speed kicks in
i go to the store for nothing
and walk right by
the house where you lived with snow white
i wonder if she ever thought
the storybook tiles on the roof were too much
but from the window, it's not a bad show
if your favorite thing's dianetics or stucco
the drugstores are open all night
the only real reason i moved to the east side
i love a good place to hide in plain sight
what if i told you
i feel like i know you?
but we never met
and here, everyone knows you're the way to my heart
hear so many stories of you at the bar
most times, alone, and some, looking your worst
but never not sweet to the trust funds and punishers
man, i wish that i could say the same
i swear i'm not angry, that's just my face
a copycat killer with a chemical cut
either i'm careless or i wanna get caught
who i'm not
what if i told you
i feel like i know you?
but we never met
it's for the best
i can't open my mouth and forget how to talk
'cause even if i could
wouldn't know where to start
wouldn't know when to stop
