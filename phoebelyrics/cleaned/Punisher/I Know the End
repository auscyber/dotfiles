somewhere in germany, but i can't place it
man, i hate this part of texas
close my eyes, fantasize
three clicks and i'm home
when i get back i'll lay around
then i'll get up and lay back down
romanticize a quiet life
there's no place like my room
but you had to go, i know, i know, i know
like a wave that crashed and melted on the shore
not even the burnouts are out here anymore
and you had to go, i know, i know, i know
out in the park, we watch the sunset
talking on a rusty swing set
after a while you went quiet
and i got mean
i'm always pushing you away from me
but you come back with gravity
and when i call, you come home
a bird in your teeth
so i gotta go, i know, i know, i know
when the sirens sound, you'll hide under the floor
but i'm not gonna go down with my hometown in a tornado
i'm gonna chase it, i know, i know, i know
i gotta go now, i know, i know, i know
driving out into the sun
let the ultraviolet cover me up
went looking for a creation myth
ended up with a pair of cracked lips
windows down, scream along
to some america first rap country song
a slaughterhouse, an outlet mall
slot machines, fear of god
windows down, heater on
big bolt of lightning hanging low
over the coast, everyone's convinced
it's a government drone or an alien spaceship
either way, we're not alone
i'll find a new place to be from
a haunted house with a picket fence
to float around and ghost my friends
no, i'm not afraid to disappear
the billboard said "the end is near"
i turned around, there was nothing there
yeah, i guess the end is here
the end is here
the end is here
the end is here
the end is... ahh!
