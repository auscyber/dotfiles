emotional affair
overly sincere
smoking in the car, windows up
crocodile tears, run the tap 'til it's clear
drift off on the floor
i drag you to the shore
sweating through the sheets
you're gonna drown in your sleep for sure
wake up and start a big fire
in our one room apartment
but i'm too tired
to have a pissing contest
all the bad dreams that you hide
show me yours, i'll show you mine
call me when you land
i'll drive around again
one hand on the wheel, one in your mouth
turn me on and turn me down
baby, you're a vampire
you want blood and i promised
i'm a bad liar
with a savior complex
all the skeletons you hide
show me yours, and i'll show you mine
all the bad dreams that you hide
show me yours
