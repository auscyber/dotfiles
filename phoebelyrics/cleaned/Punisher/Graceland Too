no longer a danger to herself or others
she made up her mind and laced up her shoes
yelled down the hall, but nobody answered
so she walked outside without an excuse
she can do anything she wants to
she can do whatever she wants to do
she can go home, but she's not going to
so she picks a direction, it's ninety in memphis
turns up the music so thoughts don't intrude
predictably winds up thinking of elvis
and wonders if he believed songs could come true
i'm asking for it if they do
doesn't know what she wants or what she's gonna do
a rebel without a clue
so we spent what was left of our serotonin
to chew on our cheeks and stare at the moon
said she knows she lived through it to get to this moment
ate a sleeve of saltines on my floor and i knew then
i would do anything you want me to
i would do anything for you
i would do anything, i would do anything
whatever you want me to do, i will do
whatever she wants
whatever she wants
whatever she wants (whatever you want)
whatever she wants (whatever you want)
i would do anything (whatever you want)
i would do anything (whatever you want)
whatever she wants (whatever you want)
whatever she wants (whatever you want)
