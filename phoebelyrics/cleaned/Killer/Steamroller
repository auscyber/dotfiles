i am tired of being sad
i feel it when i wake up
and it just stays bad
it hits me like a sickness
or a steamroller
makes me wanna lay down
and get run over
but then i see you
always smiling
makes me wanna touch you
keep from dying
you're a brother to me
you're my partner in crime
you're the feeling i get
when i'm feeling fine
part of me wants you
but most of me needs you
so i won't fall unless you ask me to
we talk for hours
until finally
sleep takes over
the amphetamines
in the darkness
i feel your fingers
they don't touch me
but theres a danger
you're a brother to me
you're my partner in crime
your the feeling i get
when i'm feeling fine
part of me wants you
but most of me needs you
so i won't fall unless you ask me
you're a brother to me
you're my partner in crime
you're the feeling i get
when i'm feeling fine
part of me wants you
but most of me needs you
so i won't fall unless you ask me
