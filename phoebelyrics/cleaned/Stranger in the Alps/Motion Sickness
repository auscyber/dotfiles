i hate you for what you did
and i miss you like a little kid
i faked it every time
but that's alright
i can hardly feel anything
i hardly feel anything at all
you gave me fifteen hundred
to see your hypnotherapist
i only went one time
you let it slide
fell on hard times a year ago
was hoping you would let it go, and you did
i have emotional motion sickness
somebody roll the windows down
there are no words in the english language
i could scream to drown you out
i'm on the outside looking through
you're throwing rocks around your room
and while you're bleeding on your back
in the glass
i'll be glad that i made it out
and sorry that it all went down like it did
i have emotional motion sickness
somebody roll the windows down
there are no words in the english language
i could scream to drown you out
hey, why do you sing with an english accent?
i guess it's too late to change it now
you know i'm never gonna let you have it
but i will try to drown you out
you said when you met me, you were bored
you said when you met me, you were bored
and you, you were in a band when i was born
i have emotional motion sickness
i try to stay clean and live without
and i want to know what would happen
if i surrender to the sound
surrender to the sound
