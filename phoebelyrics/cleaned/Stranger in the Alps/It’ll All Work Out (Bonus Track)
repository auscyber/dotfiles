she wore faded jeans and soft black leather
she had eyes so blue they looked like weather
when she needed me i wasn't around
that's the way it goes, it'll all work out
there were times apart and times together
i was pledged to her for worse or better
when it mattered most i let her down
that's the way it goes, it'll all work out
it'll all work out eventually
better off with him than here with me
now the wind is high and the rain is heavy
the water's rising in the levee
still i think of her when the sun goes down
never goes away, but it all works out
never goes away, but it all works out
