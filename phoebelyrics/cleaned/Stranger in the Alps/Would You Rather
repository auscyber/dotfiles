playing "would you rather"
when it comes to fire
you always say that you'd prefer to drown
you were still in the ambulance
when the cop suggested you're the one
who tried to burn it down
come to find out
i'm a can on a string, you're on the end
we found our way out
of the suicide pact of our family and friends
in the background, i'll be waiting
we have the same face
i laid awake as someone shoved you up against a wall
quarantined in a bad dream
he's half the man and you're twice as tall
come to find out
i'm a can on a string, you're on the end
we found our way out
of the suicide pact of our family and friends
in the background, i'll be waiting
next time i see you, you'll show me
a hundred different ways to say the same things
come to find out
i'm a can on a string, you're on the end
we found our way out
of the suicide pact of our family and friends
and when you touch down, i'll be waving
