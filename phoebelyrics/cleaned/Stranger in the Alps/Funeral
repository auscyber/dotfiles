i'm singing at a funeral tomorrow
for a kid a year older than me
and i've been talking to his dad; it makes me so sad
when i think too much about it i can't breathe
and i have this dream where i'm screaming underwater
while my friends are waving from the shore
and i don't need you to tell me what that means
i don't believe in that stuff anymore
jesus christ, i'm so blue all the time
and that's just how i feel
always have and i always will
i always have and always will
i have a friend i call
when i've bored myself to tears
and we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves
but then we laugh until it disappears
and last night, i blacked out in my car
and i woke up in my childhood bed
wishing i was someone else, feeling sorry for myself
when i remembered someone's kid is dead
jesus christ, i'm so blue all the time
and that's just how i feel
always have and i always will
i always have and always will
and it's 4 a.m. again
and i'm doing nothing
again
