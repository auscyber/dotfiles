i went with you up to the place you grew up in
we spent a week in the cold
just long enough to walden it with you
any longer, it would've got old
singing "ace of spades" when lemmy died
but nothing's changed, l.a.'s alright
i'm sleeping in my bed again, and getting in my head
and then, walk around the reservoir
you, you must've been looking for me
sending smoke signals
pelicans circling
burning trash out on the beach
one of your eyes is always half-shut
something happened when you were a kid
i didn't know you then and i'll never understand
why it feels like i did
"how soon is now" in an 80s sedan
you slept inside of it because your dad
lived in a campground in the back of a van
you said that song'll creep you out until you're dead
and you must've been looking for me
sending smoke signals
pelicans circling
burning trash out on the beach
i want to live at the holiday inn
where somebody else makes the bed
we'll watch tv while the lights on the street
put all the stars to death
it's been on my mind since bowie died
just checking out to hide from life
and all of our problems, i'm gonna solve 'em
with you riding shotgun, speeding, 'cause fuck the cops
and you, you must've been looking for me
sending smoke signals
pelicans circling
burning trash out on the beach
i buried a hatchet, it's coming up lavender
the future's unwritten; the past is a corridor
i'm at the exit, looking back through the hall
you are anonymous, i am a concrete wall
