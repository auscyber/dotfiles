take a dirty picture, babe
i can't sleep and i miss your face
in my hands and in my knees
tell me what you wanna do to me
tell me what you'll do, please
i don't wanna be alone
don't wanna be alone anymore
it got quiet on the other line
said the sun was coming up, and i
laughed until i couldn't breathe
now i'm too tired to go to sleep
now i can't breathe, and i can't sleep
i don't wanna be stoned
i don't wanna be stoned anymore
i don't wanna be alone
don't wanna be alone anymore
i've got a good feeling
i've got a good feeling
it doesn't happen very often
