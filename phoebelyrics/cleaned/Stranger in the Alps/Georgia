georgia, georgia, i love your son
and when he gets older, he might be the one
he might be the one
georgia, georgia, he has beautiful bones
and he never lies or picks up his phone
and sometimes in the pouring rain
he'll fall in the mud and get back up again
and if you find me, will you know me?
will you take me, or will you fall?
here is my day plan, here's my new machine
he is a fine new addition, so young and so clean
so young and so clean
he came up through the water without a sound
with my back to the shoreline, i dreamt that he drowned
i dreamt that he drowned
and sometimes, when he looks at me
i know he needs you, you're all that he sees
and if i breathe you, will it kill me?
will you have me, or watch me fall?
if i fix you, will you hate me?
and would you fuck this and let us fall?
