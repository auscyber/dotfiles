if we make it through december
everything's gonna be alright, i know
it's the coldest time of winter
and i shiver when i see the falling snow
if we make it through december
got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
maybe even california
if we make it through december, we'll be fine
got laid off at the factory
and their timing is not the greatest in the world
heaven knows i've been working hard
wanted christmas to be right for my girl
i don't mean to hate december
it's meant to be the happy time of year
and my little girl don't understand
why we can't afford no christmas here
if we make it through december
everything's gonna be alright, i know
it's the coldest time of winter
and i shiver when i see the falling snow
if we make it through december
got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
maybe even california
if we make it through december, we'll be fine
maybe even california
if we make it through december, we'll be fine
