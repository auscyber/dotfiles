comin' back from the country
full of good food and lousy beer
this winter's so dry and the dirt road so dusty
at the lightest fall of rain, the bacteria bloom
you don't have to be alone to be lonesome
it's easy to forget
the sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
and it's christmas so no one can fix it
tethered to a table with that happy holiday crowd
and it's anchors aweigh
looks like smooth sailin'
but the merest hint of waves could capsize you
you don't have to be alone to be lonesome
it's so easy to forget
the sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
and it's christmas so no one can fix it
the desire for annihilation
is as common as it is unkind
and it's hard to recognize the situation
when you're desperately tryin' to have a good time
you don't have to be alone to be lonesome
it's easy to forget
the sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
and it's christmas so no one can fix it
yeah, it's christmas
so no one can fix it
