[Verse 1]
Broke into her house, saw her sitting there
Drinking coke and whiskey in her bra and underwear
Saw him in the kitchen, hanging up the phone
I asked him nicely once to pack his things and go

[Verse 2]
He gave her a reassuring look, said he wouldn't leave
But I asked him one more time, this time pulled out my shiv
Stuck him in the back, and I pulled it out slow
And I watched him fall down, and as the morning sun rose
He looked at me, he said:

[Chorus]
"You missed my heart, you missed my heart
You got me good; I knew you would
But you missed my heart, you missed my heart"
Were his last words before he died

[Verse 3]
Looking out the window, up at the blue sky
Listening to her scream, listening to her cry
A feeling of relief came over my soul
I couldn't take it any longer, and I lost control

[Verse 4]
I chased her up the stairs and I pinned her to the ground
And underneath her whimpering, I could hear the sirens sound
I rattled off a list of all the things I miss
Like going to the movies with her and the way she kissed me
[Verse 5]
Driving into downtown Wheeling, showing her off
Backyard barbecues and reunions in the park
I said I missed her skin, when she started laughing
While I clenched down on her wrist, she said
"That's quite a list, but there's one thing you missed"

[Chorus]
"You missed my heart, you missed my heart
That's quite a list, but what you really missed
You missed my heart, you missed my heart (You missed my heart)
That's quite a list, but what you really missed"

[Verse 6]
Running through the parking lot, running through the fields
Policemen on my back, something hit my skull and cracked
They dragged me off to jail, set a million dollar bail
Where I tried to tie a noose, but I failed and I broke loose

[Verse 7]
I went racing through the prison yard, shot down by a tower guard
He got me in the shins, and he got me in the arms
They strapped me in the gurney, took me off to the infirmary
Where the priest read my last rites
And just before everything went dark, I said
[Chorus]
"He missed my heart, he missed my heart (You missed my heart)
He got me good, I knew he would
But he missed my heart, he missed my heart" (You missed my heart)
And just before everything went dark

[Verse 8]
The most poetic dream came flowing like the sea
Laying there, my lifeblood draining out of me
A childhood scene, night sky, moon beams
Fishing with my friends, sittin' in the wild reeds

[Verse 9]
Watching the Ohio river flow at night
Waitin' for the bullheaded catfishes to bite
Downriver from the Moundsville Prison graveyard

[Outro]
Downriver from the Moundsville Prison graveyard
Downriver from the Moundsville Prison graveyard
Downriver from the Moundsville Prison graveyard
Downriver from the Moundsville Prison graveyard
