[Verse 1]
Walking Scott Street, feeling like a stranger
With an open heart, open container
I've got a stack of mail and a tall can
It's a shower beer, it's a payment plan

[Verse 2]
There's helicopters over my head
Every night when I go to bed
Spending money, and I earned it
When I'm lonely, that's when I'll burn it

[Chorus]
Do you feel ashamed
When you hear my name?

[Verse 3]
I asked you, "How is your sister?
I heard she got her degree."
And I said, "That makes me feel old"
You said, "What does that make me?"

[Verse 4]
I asked you, "How is playing drums?"
Said, "It's too much shit to carry"
"And what about the band?"
You said, "They're all getting married"
[Chorus]
Do you feel ashamed
When you hear my name?

[Outro]
Anyway, don't be a stranger
Anyway, don't be a stranger
Don't be a stranger
