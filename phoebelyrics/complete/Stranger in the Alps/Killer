[Verse 1]
Sometimes I think I'm a killer
I scared you in your house
I even scared myself by talking
About Dahmer on your couch
But I can't sleep next to a body
Even harmless in death
Plus, I'm pretty sure I'd miss you
And faking sleep to count your breath

[Chorus]
Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
Or is there nothing left to do for us?
I am sick of the chase
But I'm hungry for blood
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 2]
But when I'm sick and tired
And when my mind is barely there
When a machine keeps me alive
And I'm losing all my hair
I hope you kiss my rotten head
And pull the plug
Know that I've burned every playlist
And I've given all my love
[Chorus]
Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
I know there's something waiting for us
I am sick of the chase
But I'm stupid in love
And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can do
