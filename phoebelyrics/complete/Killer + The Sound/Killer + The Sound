[Verse 1: Phoebe Bridgers]
Sometimes I think I'm a killer
Scared you in your house
Even scared myself by talking
About Dahmer on your couch

[Verse 2]
But I can't sleep next to a body
Even harmless in death
Plus I'm pretty sure I'd miss you
Faking sleep to count your breath

[Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers & Noah Gundersen]
Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
Is there nothing left to do for us?
I am sick of the chase
But I'm hungry for blood
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 3: Noah Gundersen]
But when I'm sick and tired
When my mind is barely there
When a machine keeps me alive
And I'm losing all my hair
[Verse 4: Noah Gundersen & Phoebe Bridgers]
I hope you kiss my rotten head
And pull the plug
Know that I've burned every playlist
And given all my love

[Chorus 2: Phoebe Bridgers & Noah Gundersen]
Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
I know there's something waiting for us
I am sick of the chase
But I'm stupid in love
And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can do



[Verse 1: Noah Gundersen]
Nothing ever comes like it did when you were in it
Just a memory of a kid, just a washed out finish
Just a pain-in-the-ass Johnny Cash middle finger
No shooting up drugs, no quitter is a winner

[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]
Nothing ever comes like it did when you were in it
Keeping nothing for yourself like a stone cold killer
Now you're passing your people like a ship in the night
Looking to every stranger for a fight
[Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers, Noah Gundersen & Abby Gundersen]
Nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
Choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
Open up your mouth, your mouth if you want it
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down

[Verse 3: Noah Gundersen]
Hoping that you like, that you like how you're living
Relying on the kindness of strangers that you will be forgiven
How many times, how many times will you shit on what you're given?
How many times, how many times 'til you shut up and listen?

[Chorus: Noah Gundersen, Phoebe Bridgers & Abby Gundersen]
Nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
Choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
Open up your mouth, your mouth if you want it
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down

[Break: Noah Gundersen, Phoebe Bridgers & Abby Gundersen]
Nothing ever comes, ever comes
Choking like a dog, like a dog
Open up your mouth
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down

[Chorus: Noah Gundersen, Phoebe Bridgers & Abby Gundersen]
Nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
Choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
Open up your mouth if you want it
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down
