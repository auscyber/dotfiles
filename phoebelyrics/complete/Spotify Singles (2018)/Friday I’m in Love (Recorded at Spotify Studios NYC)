[Verse 1]
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday, I'm in love

[Chorus]
Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate

[Verse 2]
I don't care if Monday's black
Tuesday, Wednesday heart attack
Oh, Thursday never looking back
It's Friday, I'm in love

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Monday you can hold your head
Tuesday, Wednesday stay in bed
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
It's Friday, I'm in love
[Chorus]
Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
Friday, never hesitate

[Bridge]
Dressed up to the eyes
It's such a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throwing out your frown
Smile at the sound
As sleek as a shriek spinning round and round
Always take a big bite
Such a gorgeous sight
To see you eat in the middle of the night
You can never get enough
Enough of this stuff
It's Friday I'm in love

[Verse 4]
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday, I'm in love
