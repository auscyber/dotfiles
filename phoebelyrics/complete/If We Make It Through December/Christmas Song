[Verse 1]
Comin' back from the country
Full of good food and lousy beer
This winter's so dry and the dirt road so dusty
At the lightest fall of rain, the bacteria bloom

[Chorus]
You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

[Verse 2]
Tethered to a table with that happy holiday crowd
And it's anchors aweigh
Looks like smooth sailin'
But the merest hint of waves could capsize you

[Chorus]
You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's so easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

[Bridge]
The desire for annihilation
Is as common as it is unkind
And it's hard to recognize the situation
When you're desperately tryin' to have a good time
[Chorus]
You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

[Outro]
Yeah, it's Christmas
So no one can fix it
