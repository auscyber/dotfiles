[Chorus]
If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be alright, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine

[Verse]
Got laid off at the factory
And their timing is not the greatest in the world
Heaven knows I've been working hard
Wanted Christmas to be right for my girl
I don't mean to hate December
It's meant to be the happy time of year
And my little girl don't understand
Why we can't afford no Christmas here

[Chorus]
If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be alright, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine
