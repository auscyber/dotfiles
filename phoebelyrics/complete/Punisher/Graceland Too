[Verse 1]
No longer a danger to herself or others
She made up her mind and laced up her shoes
Yelled down the hall, but nobody answered
So she walked outside without an excuse

[Chorus]
She can do anything she wants to
She can do whatever she wants to do
She can go home, but she's not going to

[Verse 2]
So she picks a direction, it's ninety in Memphis
Turns up the music so thoughts don't intrude
Predictably winds up thinking of Elvis
And wonders if he believed songs could come true

[Chorus]
I'm asking for it if they do
Doesn't know what she wants or what she's gonna do
A rebel without a clue

[Bridge]
So we spent what was left of our serotonin
To chew on our cheeks and stare at the moon
Said she knows she lived through it to get to this moment
Ate a sleeve of saltines on my floor and I knew then
[Chorus]
I would do anything you want me to
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, I would do anything
Whatever you want me to do, I will do

[Outro]
Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
I would do anything (Whatever you want)
I would do anything (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
