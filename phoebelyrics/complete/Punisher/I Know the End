[Verse 1]
Somewhere in Germany, but I can't place it
Man, I hate this part of Texas
Close my eyes, fantasize
Three clicks and I'm home
When I get back I'll lay around
Then I'll get up and lay back down
Romanticize a quiet life
There's no place like my room

[Chorus]
But you had to go, I know, I know, I know
Like a wave that crashed and melted on the shore
Not even the burnouts are out here anymore
And you had to go, I know, I know, I know

[Verse 2]
Out in the park, we watch the sunset
Talking on a rusty swing set
After a while you went quiet
And I got mean
I'm always pushing you away from me
But you come back with gravity
And when I call, you come home
A bird in your teeth
[Chorus]
So I gotta go, I know, I know, I know
When the sirens sound, you'll hide under the floor
But I'm not gonna go down with my hometown in a tornado
I'm gonna chase it, I know, I know, I know
I gotta go now, I know, I know, I know

[Verse 3]
Driving out into the sun
Let the ultraviolet cover me up
Went looking for a creation myth
Ended up with a pair of cracked lips
Windows down, scream along
To some America First rap country song
A slaughterhouse, an outlet mall
Slot machines, fear of God
Windows down, heater on
Big bolt of lightning hanging low
Over the coast, everyone's convinced
It's a government drone or an alien spaceship
Either way, we're not alone
I'll find a new place to be from
A haunted house with a picket fence
To float around and ghost my friends
No, I'm not afraid to disappear
The billboard said "The End Is Near"
I turned around, there was nothing there
Yeah, I guess the end is here
[Outro]
The end is here
The end is here
The end is here
The end is... ahh!
