[Verse 1]
Laying down on the lawn
I'm tired of trying to get in the house
I'm thinking out loud
I've been playing dead
My whole life
And I get this feeling whenever I feel good
It'll be the last time

[Refrain]
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you

[Verse 2]
If you're a work of art
I'm standing too close
I can see the brush strokes
I hate your mom
I hate it when she opens her mouth
It's amazing to me how much you can say
When you don't know what you're talking about

[Refrain]
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you
[Verse 3]
I used to light you up
Now I can't even get you to play the drums
'Cause I don't know what I want
Until I fuck it up

[Refrain]
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something

[Outro]
I'll climb through the window again
But right now, it feels good not to stand
Then I'll leave it wide open
Let the dystopian morning light pour in
