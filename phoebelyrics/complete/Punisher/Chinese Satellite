[Verse 1]
I've been running around in circles
Pretending to be myself
Why would somebody do this on purpose
When they could do something else?
Drowning out the morning birds
With the same three songs over and over
I wish I wrote it, but I didn't so I learn the words
Hum along 'til the feeling's gone forever

[Chorus]
Took a tour to see the stars
But they weren't out tonight
So I wished hard on a Chinese satellite
I want to believe
Instead, I look at the sky and I feel nothing
You know I hate to be alone
I want to be wrong

[Verse 2]
You were screamin' at the Evangelicals
They were screamin' right back from what I remember
When you said I will never be your vegetable
Because I think when you're gone, it's forever
But you know I'd stand on the corner
Embarrassed with a picket sign
If it meant I would see you when I die
[Chorus]
Sometimes, when I can't sleep
It's just a matter of time before I'm hearing things
Swore I could feel you through the walls
But that's impossible
I want to believe
That if I go outside I'll see a tractor beam
Coming to take me to where I'm from
I want to go home
