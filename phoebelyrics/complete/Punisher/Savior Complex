[Verse 1]
Emotional affair
Overly sincere
Smoking in the car, windows up
Crocodile tears, run the tap 'til it's clear
Drift off on the floor
I drag you to the shore
Sweating through the sheets
You're gonna drown in your sleep for sure
Wake up and start a big fire
In our one room apartment
But I'm too tired
To have a pissing contest
All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours, I'll show you mine

[Verse 2]
Call me when you land
I'll drive around again
One hand on the wheel, one in your mouth
Turn me on and turn me down
Baby, you're a vampire
You want blood and I promised
I'm a bad liar
With a savior complex
All the skeletons you hide
Show me yours, and I'll show you mine
[Outro]
All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours
