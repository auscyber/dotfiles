I am tired of being sad
I feel it when I wake up
And it just stays bad
It hits me like a sickness
Or a steamroller
Makes me wanna lay down
And get run over

But then I see you
Always smiling
Makes me wanna touch you
Keep from dying

You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
You're the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine
Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me to
We talk for hours
Until finally
Sleep takes over
The amphetamines
In the darkness
I feel your fingers
They don't touch me
But theres a danger

You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
Your the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine

Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me

You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
You're the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine

Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me
